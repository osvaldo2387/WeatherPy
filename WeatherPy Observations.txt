1. There is a visual trend in the plot that relates latitude and temperature. While we move closer to Latitude 0 (Equator),
temperatures rise, and when moving far from the Equator, to North or South pole, Temperature decreases. 

2. There is not an observable trend for Cloudiness, Humidity and Wind Speed related to latitude. This can show that these 
weather conditions are not directly related to latitude as temperature is. 

3. Observing these plots, we can infer that Humidity is related to Temperature. Considering that temperature rises closer to equator, and humidity is higher
in latitudes that are closer to equator, then there is an observable relation between temperature and humidity.
